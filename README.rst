ReadTheDocs theme for pydoctor
==============================

**Thid theme is now a part of pydoctor, use it with option** ``--theme=readthedocs``.

This repository contains a collection of template files that can 
be used with `pydoctor <https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor>`_ 
to make the output more like ReadTheDocs' theme.

The genuine ReadTheDocs' CSS could not fit pydoctor's output. 

This is a streamlined adaptadation of original CSS. 

This theme does not intend to replicate the full Sphinx ReadTheDocs theme behaviour, 
but rather roughly tries to keep the same look and feel.
